What I’ve Learned
Problem-Solving Skills:
- Improved logical thinking and debugging skills.
- Learned how to break down complex problems into smaller subproblems. 

 Algorithms & Data Structures
- Sorting & Searching: Binary Search, Merge Sort, and their applications.
- Greedy Algorithms: Choosing optimal substructures for global optimum.
- Dynamic Programming (DP): Tabulation, Memoization, and pattern recognition.
- Recursion & Backtracking: Understanding depth-first approaches.
- Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, and basic understanding of shortest paths.
- Stacks, Queues, Heaps: Usage in various standard problems.
- Hashing & Sets: Efficient lookups and frequency counting.

-Did some of the problems from HackerRank, leetcode, CSES and codeforces.
- Learned to choose appropriate data structures and techniques based on problem type.
